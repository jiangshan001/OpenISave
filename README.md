# OpenISave
OpenISave is a web app designed to help you track your expenses, manage budgets, and convert between multiple currencies â€” all without the need for a paid subscription. Inspired by popular budgeting tools like Cookie, this app brings most of their functionality to an open-source, accessible platform.
